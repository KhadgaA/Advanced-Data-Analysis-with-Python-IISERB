## Some Instructions/Tips

> To understand the how the column variables are coded look `codebook_food.docx` file.

#### For Changing the location, uncomment these lines of code.


```
    # location = [17.448372, 78.526957]
    # Location of the place to search 
    # location = [23.293334, 77.272205] # IISERB
    # location=[17.98419,79.53111] # IIT-Bombay
    location = [13.020929, 77.566241]  # IISC Banglore

```
> The process of fetching the geolocation data will take time. So in order to view the already saved file, open ` map_Cluster.html ` in a new browser tab.
