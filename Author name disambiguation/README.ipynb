    "## Things to improve\n",
    "> Convertion of 'string' dtypes to one-hot vectors is      very inefficient.\n",
    "> > For Ex: Converting a Title to one hot vector just gives a array without any information of what the title meant.\n",
    "> - One other way to do this more efficiently and keep the semantic relationship between the words of title is by using word2vec.\n",
    "> > This will keep all the semantic relations and will give more accurate results when trained with a CNN.\n",
    "    - Learn more about tf and its algorithms.\n",
    "## Things to do differently\n",
    ">  Classifying each author at a time without any semantic relation between all the authors is not the way forward.\n",
    "> - One way is to make a semantic map of given data. \n",
    ">> which will provide us with the crude relations between authors and then we will train our model on that. It will be easier and more efficient for a neural network to learn the patterns.\n",
    ">  - Other way can be converting the given data into images and then classfying.\n",
    "      - This way is also more efficient but very hard.\n",
    "      - The images captures all the necessary information including title, authors, years etc.. \n",
    "      - This will make the images of more related athors more similar and will be easy to train.     \n",
    "      - Problem with this implementation:\n",
    "    >> - This method requires unsupervised classification of images, which is hard to really get into right now.\n",
